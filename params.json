{"name":"Flausenhaus.github.io","tagline":"1611 Book Club (and associated content)","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\n\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for\r\nall of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored\r\nMarkdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page\r\nis generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see\r\nthe new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\n\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to\r\nlayouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before\r\npublishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and\r\nswitch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained\r\nmarkdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named\r\n`gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to\r\nsupporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog\r\naware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes\r\nit easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them\r\nacross every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced\r\ntemplating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The\r\nresulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For\r\nexample: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom\r\nPreston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
