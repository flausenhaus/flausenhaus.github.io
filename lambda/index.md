# Better Living Through Clojure <br>
MIT IAP 2014 <br>
Bhaskar Mookerji, Aysylu Greenberg, David Greenberg <br>
*Dates*: January 14, 7:00 - 9:00PM; January 15 7:00 - 9:00PM in 4-231 <br>

Clojure is a general-purpose language with seamless Java interoperability, a
modern Lisp dialect, and a rich set of immutable, persistent data
structures. Elegant and powerful, Clojure aims to reduce the incidental
complexity of software engineering by making functional programming practical
and accessible.

The first class introduces Clojure's philosophy, Lisp syntax, and primitives
for expressive functional programming on immutable collection types. In the
second class, we'll overview some libraries for production-quality programming
in a few areas: parsing, concurrent programming, distributed databases, and
graph and dataflow programming.

The class will be interactive, with an emphasis on functional problem solving,
so bring a laptop.  Check the webpage for updates at the beginning of IAP!
